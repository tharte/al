Title: An implementation of the Lambda Calculus in R
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Thomas P.", "Harte", , "tharte@cantab.net", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: R is based on Scheme and S, so that it has the appearance of S
    but is implemented similar to Scheme. Scheme is "An Interpreter for Extended Lambda Calculus".
    Insight into the Lambda Calculus from within R therefore gives us a fresh understanding
    of R's roots in functional programming. The Lambda Calculus was created by the 
    American logician Alonzo Church in the 1930s; hence, 'al' is named in his honor.
